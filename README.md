# Disclaimer

This mod's scope is quite extensive, touching many aspect of the base game. Since this mod is a one man's work, developed on my free time, I haven't been able to extensively test all its aspects, most notably its compatibility with other mods and DLC. I therefore expect some bugs and compatibility issues (hopefully nothing game-breaking) to be found and reported.

My first objective after release will be to fix most of these bugs and compatibility issues before adding new content. If you do find a bug, please report it so that i may fix it. I could have spent more time testing, but this would mean pushing the release further and further, instead of letting the community enjoy my work.

# PokéWorld

PokéWorld adds all 493 species of Pokémon from the first four generations to RimWorld, each with their own unique characteristics akin to the original games.

Try and catch as many of these Pokémon as you can to fill up your Pokédex, battle against other wild Pokémon and raiders to gain experience and level up your Pokémon, who will learn more powerfull moves and eventually evolve to grow ever stronger!

Unlike your vanilla RimWorld animal, Pokémon can't be tamed by simply having your colonist walk up to them. Instead, you'll need to use specially crafted Poké Ball belts to catch these Pokémon. But be carefull! Most of them wont let themselves be caught without a fight!  
Once caught, you can choose to assign your new Pokémon to a colonist whom it will follow and protect, and give him orders like a regular drafted pawn while in the vicinity of his master. Or you can chose to let him rest in his Poké Ball until he is later needed.

Pokémon aren't the only addition this mod adds to RimWorld. Keep your eyes wide open when mining in the dark caves, for you might stumble onto treasure among the rocks, such as rare evolution stones, or, even rarer, ancient fossils buried deep for eons. Who knows, with the right tools, you might be able to bring these fossil back to life.

Once you start learning more and more about these strange creatures by filling your Pokédex, you'll eventually find yourself on the track of exceptionally powerful Pokémon, only ever heard of in myths and legends.

Finally, altough it is only just a rumour, it is said amongst the ancient tribes living on this planet that some individual Pokémon can show a very rare coloration, similar to the shine of a bright midnight star.

## Features

- 493 new creatures, all Pokémon from generation I-IV with working mechanics such as leveling, evolution, moves, type effectiveness, breeding, their own stats (happiness, rarity, catch rate, ...), forms and shiny variations.

- 120 Pokémon moves, 65 melee (physical) and 55 ranged (special). A Pokémon learns new moves when leveling up, and you can chose wich moves to let them uses based on type, power and range. If no other moves are available for a Pokémon, he will default to Struggle.

- A lot of Pokémon themed items, including 7 Fossils, 5 types of Poké Ball belts used to catch Pokémon, 8 Evolution stones, 3 tiers of potions, Rare Candy and every available Pokémon Eggs.

- 2 new buildings, the Pokémon resurrector, a workbench able to bring fossils back to life, and the Portable Computer, which can access the Pokémon Storage System to store up to a thousand Pokémon.

- New or reworked events and incidents, such as manhunter packs and infestations.

- 11 research projects.

- A Pokédex tab to keep track of your Pokémon collection.

- More than 30 Legendaries quests.

## Mod options

A slider allows you to set the proportions of Pokémon found in the world over other vanilla or modded animals. If you set this slider to the max (only Pokémon) you will only encounter Pokémon for the whole game, without other creatures breaking the immersion.

**Other Pokémon mod**: No.

**Mods with new biomes**: No, custom biome will not feature any Pokémon, need to patch these biomes to add Pokémon spawn rates.

Other mods will be added based on tests and feedback from the community.

## Translation

This mod is in English but should fully support translation. If you are a translator, feel free to create a patch (try to respect your respective language grammar conventions and syntax regarding the Pokémon media), the best ones will be added here. Please notice me if you find any typo / mistakes in the base (English) mod.

## Q&A

**How do I tame a Pokémon?**: Pokémon aren't tamed the same way vanilla RimWorld animals are. To catch a Pokémon, you need to equip one of your pawn with a Poké Ball belt, draft him and throw Poké Balls at a Pokémon in the hope of catching it. Some Pokémon are easier to catch than other, and weakened Pokémon are more likelly to be caught.

**Why won't my Pokémon fight?**: Make sure your Pokémon has his "Guard" trainability trained, is assigned a master and is set to follow his master while drafted. When selecting this Pokémon while his master is drafted, you will notice a blue circle aroud the master. The Pokémon can then be freely controlled like a normal pawn in this area. Stronger Pokémon master (with higher "animals" skill) have a larger area.

**How many Pokémon can I have at the same time?**: You can battle with as much Pokémon as you want, the sky is the limit.

**Do I need another mod to control my Pokémon?**: No, PokéWorld comes with a built-in Pokémon control mechanic.

**Will more Pokémon be added in the future?**: Maybe, if a lot of people request it. It wouldn't be very hard, the main difficulty is to handle Pokémon with unique features (Pokémon with forms or those like Nincada / Ditto) to make them feel unique. There is no point in having 1000 different Pokémon if they all behave the same. I would also need to find sprites for each Pokémon.

**Can I play with only x Pokémon / x generation?** No. I initially tought of releasing each generation as a separate mod to let players chose which Pokémon they wanted to play with, but this would have been exhausting work considering this is my first mod ever. There's also the issue of evolution lines beeing separated over different generation, amongst other things.

**Did you draw each of the Pokémon textures yourself?**: No, there is more than 3000 sprites in total (493 Pokémon x 3 orientation for regular and shiny variation, not accounting forms or gender differences). I used existing ressources (HeartGold & SoulSilver overworld sprites, reason for which there's only the first four generations) and a bit of image manipulation (XBR smooth scaling) to make them more RimWorld friendly.

## Known Issues

- Missing textures for Sunny/Rainy/Snowy forms of Castform, and Sunshine form of Cherrim.

- Some Pokémon do not have any unlockable moves.

- Ditto transform isn't implemented (yet).

## What's next?

- Fixing bugs and improving compatibility.

- Moves effect and animation, such as thunder dropping when using Thunder / Thunderbolt, have a meteor fall when using Draco Meteor, explosions, status moves, ...
